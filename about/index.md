# me
![moswald](me.png "me")

My name is Matt Oswald, shortened to _moswald_ as my online handle for nearly every service available. I am a software developer by trade,
a father and husband, and a somewhat lapsed gamer.

# what I do
I make very tiny, distributed things and mobile applications. Often, those overlap, which is always fun and interesting.

I currently work for [Wayne Fueling Systems](http://wayne.com), writing software to monitor and manage their many fuel dispensers sold around
the world.

# where I do it
Wayne is headquarted in Austin, TX, which is a fantastic place to live and work. My first "real" job was in downtown Austin, and
it will always feel like a second home to me. After nearly twenty years there however, we've decided to move back to the Midwest near my hometown.
Being a software developer means all I really need is my computer and a fast internet connection, and I was amazed to discover that just about
anyone living in central MO could get fiber. :wat:

# why I do it
When I was six, you had to drive thirty miles to visit the mall where there was an arcade, and the video games inside were giant machines
(to a kid). That Christmas everything changed when my dad brought home an Atari 2600. I was floored. Here was _Space Invaders_ in my
_living room_! It was at that point that my future was decided: I would write video games when I grew up.

Since then, I _have_ written video games for a living (always on the fringe of the games industry), but it's not always the most stable of
professions, and I find that I also just love working on software in general. Besides, I enjoy playing games as much as I do writing them,
and it's a lot easier to get started playing. ;)

I've got half a dozen projects that I work on in my spare time, but don't really expect to ever finish them. Tinkering on these games, apps, and
open-source libraries are the equivalent of the guy with the classic car in his garage that he tinkers with every weekend, but never
drives. It keeps my skills sharp, and I get some satisfaction of making incremental progress toward some lofty goal.

# what else I do
I'm a father to two ~~little~~ young boys (as well as a wonderful daughter, attending college in TX), and they keep me fairly busy.
I also have a lovely wife, and I treasure the rare alone time we get to spend together.

Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a huge baseball fan (when the boys were younger, I would watch upwards of 150 Yankees games a year),
enjoy college basketball, and get to all-too-infrequently play in softball leagues.
